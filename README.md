# make-your-game

A browser-based implementation of the classic Space Invaders arcade game. The game challenges players to control a shooter at the bottom of the screen to defend against waves of alien invaders that move across and down the screen.

How to Play
Movement: Use the left (←) and right (→) arrow keys to move the shooter.
Shooting: Use the up arrow key (↑) to shoot at the aliens.
Objective: Destroy all the alien invaders while avoiding getting hit or letting them reach the bottom.
Lives: Start with 3 lives; losing all lives will result in a game over.

Installation
Clone the repository and open index.html in your preferred browser to start playing:

git clone git@github.com:basmahsalmann/make-your-game.git
